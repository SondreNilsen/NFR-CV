  abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the association between family structure and adolecent mental health, after the considerable increase in divorced parents choosing joint physical custody (JPC) in Norway. Data stem from the youth@hordaland study, a population-based survey conducted in Norway in 2012. A total of 7,707 adolescents (47\% male) 16 to 19 years old were included in this study. The adolescents were classified into 6 family structures. Mental health was measured using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). No significant differences between nondivorced families (reference) and JPC were observed. Adolescents from single-parent and stepfather families scored significantly higher on all 3 SDQ scales, and adolescents from stepmother families scored significantly higher on the SDQ total and SDQ externalizing scales. In conclusion, the results of this study indicated that adolescents living in JPC did not have more adjustment problems compared to their peers living in nondivorced families.},

  abstract = {Aims: The structure of adolescents' families has become more complex over the last decades in several western countries. In parallel, health complaints among adolescents appear to have risen in the Nordic countries. This study aimed to examine the association between family structure and health complaints among Norwegian adolescents while capturing biological, half-, and stepsiblings (sibship-type) in the families. Methods: Data stem from the youth@hordaland study, an epidemiological study of adolescents aged 16\textendash{}19 years (N = 10,257; participation rate = 53\%) conducted in 2012. This study is based on a subsample of 8808 adolescents who lived with parent(s). The adolescents provided detailed information on sociodemographics, family structure, sibship-type, and common health complaints among youth (headache, dizziness, and abdominal, neck, back, and shoulder pain). Results: Adolescents in nuclear families and joint physical custody (JPC) reported significantly lower levels of health complaints compared to peers in single- or stepparent families. Independent of family structure, biological siblings were associated with lower levels of health complaints, while stepsiblings were associated with higher levels of health complaints, but only among girls. These findings were robust to adjustments of sociodemographic variables. Conclusions: Health complaints are frequent but unequally distributed across family structures. Adolescents in nuclear families and JPC report lower levels of health complaints compared to peers in single- or stepparent families. Considering siblings appears to be relevant, as biological- and stepsiblings were related to adolescents' symptoms, independent of family structure. In combination, knowledge about family structure and sibship-type may aid the identification of adolescents at risk of experiencing health complaints.},

  abstract = {Prenatal exposure to substances can possibly influence a child's neurodevelopment and may impact on subsequent mental health. We investigated the mental health status of school-aged children referred to a pediatric hospital with a history of prenatal exposure to alcohol or other substances. Mental health was assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and compared with a reference group. A total of 105 of 128 (82\%) eligible children prenatally exposed to substances participated in the study, with 48 children exposed to alcohol and 57 to other substances. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire subscale mean scores, total difficulties scores, and total impact scores were statistically significantly higher in the group of exposed children, compared with the reference group. In this hospital-based population of school-aged children prenatally exposed to alcohol or other substances, the exposed group had an increased risk of mental health problems, compared with the reference group.},
